<h1>Ash47's AI Experiments</h1>

<h3>01 - Learning to Dodge</h3>
<p>Click <a href="/AiExperiments/01 Learning to Dodge/" target="_blank">here</a> to try it out!</p>
<p>This is a simple AI that does it's best to learn how to dodge projectiles that randomly come towards it.</p>
<p>This simulation will spawn 100 random AIs, each AI is randomly generated, and will receive a score based on how well it is avoiding the projectiles. The best of these AIs will be bred to hopefully create a new generation that is actually able to dodge. The longer you watch, the better the AI should become!</p>
