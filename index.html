<h1>Ash47's AI Experiments</h1>

<h3>01 - Ai Learning to Dodge</h3>
<p>Click <a href="/AiExperiments/01 Learning to Dodge/" target="_blank">here</a> to try it out!</p>
<p>This is a simple AI that does it's best to learn how to dodge projectiles that randomly come towards it.</p>
<p>This simulation will spawn 100 random AIs, each AI is randomly generated, and will receive a score based on how well it is avoiding the projectiles. The best of these AIs will be bred to hopefully create a new generation that is actually able to dodge. The longer you watch, the better the AI should become!</p>

<h3>02 - Flappy Bird AI</h3>
<p>Click <a href="/AiExperiments/02 Flappy Bird/" target="_blank">here</a> to try it out!</p>
<p>This AI tries to learn how to play Flappy Bird based on trial and error.</p>
<p>This simulation will spawn 25 random AIs, each AI is randomly generated, and will receive a score based on how long it stays alive. The best of these AIs will be bred to hopefully create a new generation that is actually able to dodge. The longer you watch, the better the AI should become!</p>

<h3>03 - Ouchy Bird AI</h3>
<p>Click <a href="/AiExperiments/03 Ouchy Bird/" target="_blank">here</a> to try it out!</p>
<p>This AI tries to learn how to play Ouchy Bird.</p>
<p>We take the approach of creating two seperate brains -- one brain to solve the bird being dropped to the left, and one to solve the bird being dropped to the right.</p>
