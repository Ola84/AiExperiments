Here's a bunch of experimental self learning AIs

## Main Hub
 - You can find details on all of the experiments directly [here](https://ash47.github.io/AiExperiments/)

## 01 - AI Learning to Dodge
 - This is a simple AI that does it's best to learn how to dodge projectiles that randomly come towards it.
 - This simulation will spawn 100 random AIs, each AI is randomly generated, and will receive a score based on how well it is avoiding the projectiles. The best of these AIs will be bred to hopefully create a new generation that is actually able to dodge. The longer you watch, the better the AI should become!

## 02 - Flappy Bird AI
 - This AI tries to learn how to play Flappy Bird based on trial and error.
 - This simulation will spawn 25 random AIs, each AI is randomly generated, and will receive a score based on how long it stays alive. The best of these AIs will be bred to hopefully create a new generation that is actually able to dodge. The longer you watch, the better the AI should become!

## 03 - Ouchy Bird AI
 - This AI tries to learn how to play Ouchy Bird.
 - We take the approach of creating two seperate brains -- one brain to solve the bird being dropped to the left, and one to solve the bird being dropped to the right.

## 04 - Ninja AI Training
 - This AI is a self learning Ninja! Throw ninja stars and the AI will learn how to dodge them!
 - Move your cursor to the left hand side of the screen so automatically throw ninja stars, or move your cursor to the right hand side and click to manually throw stars.
 - We're using neutral networks that learn over time to generate AIs. It will learn how to dodge based on how you attack it. How many generations until it can beat you?
